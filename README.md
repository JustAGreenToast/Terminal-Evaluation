This is the source code for Terminal Evaluation, a game made by me which you can download here:
https://justagreentoast.itch.io/terminal-evaluation-demo

This repository will be updated every time a new public release is, well, released. Be wary of spoilers, in case you haven't seen everything in the game yet, and of unused content which might appear in future updates.

This project is made in Unity 2022.1.4f1, in case you want to open it in the Unity Editor. Some files, such as the contents of the AudioImporter and MinGW folders are excluded and will need to be added manually.
